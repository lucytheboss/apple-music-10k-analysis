# apple-music-10k-analysis
A complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) and insight report built using a 10,000-track Apple Music dataset. This project showcases real-world analytics used by Apple’s editorial, business, and content strategy teams.

## Key Findings
**1. Genre Landscape**
Pop dominates the dataset, followed by country, rock, alternative, and hip-hop/rap. A long-tail distribution shows niche genres like musicals, holiday, and R&B/Soul.

**2. Release Year Trends**
Music releases increase sharply after 2000, reflecting the rise of digital distribution and the shift to streaming-first release strategies.

**3. Track Duration Patterns**
Commercial genres cluster tightly around 3–4 minutes, while classical, jazz, and soundtrack genres contain longer tracks (6–10+ minutes).

**4. Explicit Content**
Explicit content is concentrated almost entirely in hip-hop subgenres (up to 100% in Dirty South). Pop and dance remain largely family-friendly.

**5. Top Artists**
Taylor Swift, One Direction, Glee Cast, Michael Jackson, and Ed Sheeran are among the most represented artists, indicating strong catalog depth.

**6. Album Structure**
Most albums contain 10–15 tracks (standard commercial structure). Deluxe editions extend to 20–25 tracks; box sets may exceed 40+.

**7. Country**
Dataset is primarily U.S. metadata; this is noted as a dataset limitation.

**8. Seasonal Release Trends**
Release peaks occur in January, September, October, and November — aligning with industry cycles and holiday-season promotion.

**9. Genre Seasonal Patterns (Heatmap)**
Pop releases are consistent year-round.
Hip-hop/rap peaks in spring/summer.
Rock peaks in spring and fall.
Holiday and Christmas genres spike sharply in November/December.
